# AtliQ Mart-Supply Chain Analysis-POWER BI


<a href="https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge">This is my Power BI project on FMCG Domain - Supply Chain Analysis from Codebasics Resume Challenge </a>


### Problem statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

###### FMCG Domain - Supply Chain Knowledge:
<ol>
  <li>Through sources like Codebasics Resume Challenge support files gained knowledge about Supply Chain management and how Data Analysis is used to evaluate effectiveness of delivery process, manufacturing and logistics and potential bottlenecks in the supply chain.</li>
  <li>Learned about KPIs like OT, IF, OTIF, LIFR, VOFR, COC time and how they are studied using data analysis</li>
  <li>Got an understanding of how these KPI insights are used to make informed decisions to improve business</li>
</ol>

###### Insights from the dashboard:
<ol>
  <li>When compared vs Target, all the KPIs show negative trend over different time filters.</li>
  <li> Lotus Mart, Acclaimed Stores are the top customers followed by Vijay Stores, Rel Fresh, Coolblue (by Total Order column sorted in descending order)</li>
  <li>Average COC time for all customers is more especially for the top once it's high which indicates the slower response from company towards customer orders affecting other key metrics too.</li>
  <li>Top 5 products : AM Milk 250, AM Milk 100, AM Milk 500, AM Curd 50, AM Curd 100</li>
  <li>LIFR %  is low for all the products which indicates that company is unable to meet their customers' demands, fulfill orders quickly and maintain positive customer satisfaction rate</li>
  <li>From Trend by City - in all three cities the metrics are way behind their respective target percentage. Here company can reflect on some points such as transportation accessibility, logistics service demand, economic development, availability and cost of the labor force, local policy and planning.</li>
